					<description>The 80s action flick had a guy with a mullet who had an uzi.  I think that says everything.  I don't know what they were saying and it didn't matter.  It was a cheap VCD and skipped a lot but made for great diner entertainment.  It was almost as cool as movie night.

Sorry it took me forever to check the comments this time.</description>

					<description>Ditto to everything Amy said, as always. I'm really proud of you Will and I miss you man. Just finished reading this blog and now I think I'll drink and listen to "Don't know what you got till it's gone" by Cinderella on a nonstop loop for an hour.</description>

					<description>I think I am going to hell because I laughed at that poor crab for almost a half hour waking up Mary Beth and scaring the cat. Will I can visualize you doing all this. Thank your for taking the time to post this stuff. It really makes my day for night. I will be anticipateing parts IV and V and maybe then you can do a recap prequel I, II, and III. 

Oh yeah. They bagged a Colossal squid of the coast of Antarctica 38 ft, and we were graced with a total lunar eclipse here on the East coast last Saturday. 

Keep em coming!</description>
