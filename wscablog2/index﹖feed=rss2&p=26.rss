					<description>I was in Tampa visiting my best friend last week and I brought home some fireworks for Luke.  I told the woman in the store I wanted something that could potentially blow off his arm and face at the same time.  I was proud of myself for the mortars and broom handle sized roman candles I got him.  That is, until I read this blog about your dynamite.  Now I just feel inferior and embarrassed.</description>
