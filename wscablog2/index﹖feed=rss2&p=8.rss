					<description>Will Sanders, I swear before God I peed on myself (if only but a little) when I read this.  Please take care and send me a small Chinese girl to help with the housework.  I don't have too much, but I do have a 40" television, and VH1 has really stepped up the programming this season.

Love,
Michelle</description>

					<description>oh mr. sanders, i feel ya! especially on the fishy nasty fish in weird sauce. i, too, had a whole fish in weird sauce my first day here in korea, and it was fucking awful. i, too, was stared at the whole time, and i think the waitresses intentionally seated me smack dab in the middle of the restaurant (which had the sign "good korean restaurant for foreigners" out front). fish here is totally different. good luck finding a good grilled salmon. 

also feel ya on the staring in general--it won't ever stop. i wonder if you'll get as tired of it as i have. especially of the pointing and laughing variety. 


also feel ya on the driving. took a taxi a few weeks ago where the driver felt it necessary to drive 130 km. laughing maniacally.

also on the disparity in pay (though it is not quite so bad here in freedomland). 

feel ya on so many things. it gets really rough sometimes, but always interesting, often fun. good luck, dude.

and i will email you teaching ideas. high school students, right? i've got loads of ideas i've used.</description>

					<description>So what do you think the thermos is for anyway? Any hot chicks yet? Are you going to the friday night communist disco? Do they drink beer or  does it come with a little goldfish in it? 

I bet the party guy is there to enforce communist brainwashing. I would avoid teaching them the pledge of allegiance in class, just to stay on his good side. I hope you were able to get one of those "American by birth, southern by the grace of god" t-shirts so you could represent. 

MMMmmmm I could go for some dumplings.... 

lots of love

					<description>Please let me know if you find a Chinese restaurant that serves mongolian beef.  Good to know the dumplings are alright.  You can always order those.</description>
