					<description>Will, I can't believe I just read this blog and the next one today...being out of town last weekend must have thrown me off my game.  I assure you that I AM a faithful blog-believer.  I do hope that you had a wonderful birthday, and I hope you are having fun out there in your dorky cap.  I love you mucho!  Can't wait to hear your stories when you get back "home!"</description>
