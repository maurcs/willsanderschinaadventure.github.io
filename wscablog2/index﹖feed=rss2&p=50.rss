					<description>Hey Will, Jane seems so nice and so sweet. I hope to meet her some day and thank her for being so nice to you. And also make her eat every variety of pizza until she likes one. It's Pizza!

Also the title is one of your best.</description>

					<description>Will, you two are so sweet you make me want to barf.  In a good way.

I'm sad for me and Ryan, but so happy for you that it makes up for both of our sadness at having to wait an extra six months to see you. =)</description>
