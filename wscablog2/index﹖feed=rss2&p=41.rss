					<description>I am glad you love how long it is, it did take me a while, I didn't want to leave any of the cool stuff out.  I have very few things to do these days.  I saw the episode where Andrew Zimmern went to Japan and made mention of but did not consume a glass of wine with a deer penis.  I have seen wine with whole snakes here though.  Haven't tried it yet.

					<description>Will--this took me forever to read (which I love, by the way)...but I can't even imagine how long it took you to write!  Now you are my own personal Andrew Zimmern (the guy I TIVO who eats weird stuff all over the world)!  Your visit sounds amazing...I think it is rad that you got to walk around on the Great Wall.  Just call me uber-jealous.</description>
