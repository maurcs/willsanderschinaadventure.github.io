					<description>I've always said there's two kinds of Germans: very pretentious, and very goofy. Anyway, they all eat piles of meat for breakfast lunch and dinner, and that's cool with me. 

...have you tried baby yet?</description>

					<description>Ryan is disappointed that you missed the Slade question.  He'd like to remind you that he made you a CD of Slade's greatest hits, so you should have known!  He tells me that, in fact, the song was written by Noddy Holder, the singer for Slade. =)

By the way, I am supremely jealous of your night on the pier, sipping beer, looking at the stars, and eating fish on a stick.  Sounds perfect.</description>
