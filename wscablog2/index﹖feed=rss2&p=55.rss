					<description>The kids notes sound great. I would have cried in front of them. There have been a few occasions when a strange guy was next to me in a costume, only to find out later it was you. You are good at costumes. I think I said it before, will keep on rocking in the not so free world.
I hope to see you before too long. Have fun.</description>

					<description>Wish we could have seen your band's big premiere....that sounds incredible!  Also, it sounds like you are almost as much loved over there as you are here, which is awesome! (You know I have to say "almost" right?)

We love you Will Sanders.  We'll talk before you head off anywhere, okay?</description>
