					<p> </p>
<p align="left">So yesterday I was having diner with Alice.  I mentioned her a few posts back, she is an English teacher at my school and maybe the best friend I have here.  A while ago I had given her the address of this website but never heard back from her about it, I suppose I had assumed that she had never bothered to read it.  For some reason, somehow, I don&#8217;t remember how it came up in conversation and I said something like &#8220;Oh, yeah did you ever go to my website?&#8221;  She said she did and she didn&#8217;t like it.  The post I wrote maybe last month, <em>Dirt, eating and drinking </em>was where she had the problem.  She didn&#8217;t like seeing her country being criticized by the likes of me, an American.  She said that while she agreed with many of the things I said, to her it was insulting coming from me.  I think it is like if you went to my house and I had a dirty floor (which I totally did until yesterday, yes friends I swept on my own accord) and I knew I had a dirty floor.  If you came into my house and said &#8216;well your house sucks because the floor is all dirty&#8217; I would be pissed because its my house!  This is my take on her argument, of coarse but I think she would agree we talked about it for a long time, you see.  In the end of the conversation, I commented that from her point of view she must think I was being very arrogant and she said that said that this was the word that she had been thinking of but I think she is way too nice to say it.  She is right.  So much is strange here to me that it is easy to focus on the problems and not appreciate the positive.  For the record, I love it here, and I love China.  So I guess I just want to try and make a list of all the things I like and love about China, but in no particular order.  In time I will think up more things I love, I will try to start mentioning them as the arrize.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"><strong>THINGS I LOVE ABOUT CHINA:</strong></p>
<p>*My friends Alice, May, Gina, Han Xiao Yin, Michelle and Wei</p>
<p align="center">*Smiling faces (much better than American scowls)</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese people can be very direct and honest </p>
<p align="center">*Taxis made from motorcycles</p>
<p align="center">*Food, even the weird stuff is yummy if you give it a chance.</p>
<p align="center">*traveling by train</p>
<p align="center">*They pay poor people to pick up trash which kills 2 birds with one stone.  In America if they tried this they would have a whole lot of crack heads stealing garbage cans but here it works fine.</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese New Year</p>
<p align="center">*Jackie Chan</p>
<p align="center">*Yau Ming of the Huston Rockets</p>
<p align="center">*My students are the most wonderful inquisitive people and I love a good 95% of them.  With over 1000 kids that says a lot I think.</p>
<p align="center">*Journey to the West (the TV show, I haven&#8217;t read the book yet)</p>
<p align="center">*Monkeys</p>
<p align="center">*Pandas</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese Mountains</p>
<p align="center">*The Great Wall</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese History</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese people&#8217;s pride in their countries pandas, mountains, great wall, and history.  Among other stuff too.  It is like if someone from another country mentioned mount Rushmoore and you smilied like you had carved it yourself.</p>
<p align="center">*China is such a huge place, and it only has one time zone!</p>
<p align="center">*Ancient buildings</p>
<p align="center">*Yangshou</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese traditional music</p>
<p align="center">*Beijing punk music</p>
<p align="center">*At meal times the streets are teaming with sidewalk food venders, they have wheeled carts with fryers and steamers and bicycles converted into mobil ovens.  It is cheap and it is good good good!  Everyone enjoys their supper sitting in tiny kindergarten sized plastic chairs at tiny tables and drinks beer and laughs.  Now that its hot its all guys sitting around without shirts screaming with laughter.</p>
<p align="center">*quite lazy days spent under a Chinese tree reading a nice book someplace in China</p>
<p align="center">*Guilin</p>
<p align="center">*I don&#8217;t have to tip.  If I tried they would think I had lost my fool mind.</p>
<p align="center">*Every time I meet a Chinese person who speaks English the first thing they say is always &#8220;My English is not so good.&#8221; and it is usually fine.  Always better than my Chinese.</p>
<p align="center">*Riding my bike through China amid the cars and motorcycles is like being on a speeder bike on the moon of Endoor. </p>
<p align="center">*Children greet me all the time by saying &#8220;Hello&#8221; which I think is nice</p>
<p align="center">*Little Children react to me in a similar way to the way Elliot and Drew Barrymore reacted to meeting ET for the first time.</p>
<p align="center">*Did I mention the food?</p>
<p align="center">*Dumplings get their own category they are so good</p>
<p align="center">*eating dog (don&#8217;t knock it if you ain&#8217;t tried it)</p>
<p align="center">*being lost in China is so scary and fun</p>
<p align="center">*I have a Chinese nick name.  Hi lea, which means drinks the ocean.  It refers to my ability to put away pi zhou (beer)</p>
<p align="center">*looking out the window and seeing China</p>
<p align="center">*learning a new language the hard way (although I am still lousy at it)</p>
<p align="center">*Dvds are cheap and bootleg</p>
<p align="center">*I got these great slippers that are so cool, they are just like the ones Chinese guys wear.</p>
<p align="center">*I get a lot of attention, like I&#8217;m somebody fancy.</p>
<p align="center">*Spicy food is really really good</p>
<p align="center">*Sleeping on a train</p>
<p align="center">*having cool stuff to write about adventure wise</p>
<p align="center">*digging on another culture, learning the subtle ins and outs of when it is not polite to show up without pants.  (pretty much always it turns out.)</p>
<p align="center">*When I dream I am having crazy I&#8217;m in China dreams.</p>
<p align="center">*The Yunnan province is awesome</p>
<p align="center">*So is Hainan</p>
<p align="center">*Meat on a stick</p>
<p align="center">*Chinese fireworks are massive</p>
<p align="center">*I teach kid the hi five and its new</p>
<p align="center">*Last week I taught kids about The Clash and the Ramones and Outcast and Gnarles Barkley. </p>
<p align="center">*I go to one restaurant where the guy who runs the place knows me and last time gave me a free bottle of bi zhou.</p>
<p align="center">*Many Chinese woman are pia leo</p>
<p align="center">*all prices are negotiable.  Nobody ever pays the named price.</p>
<p align="center">*Tea</p>
<p align="center">*Buddhism</p>
<p align="center">*Young people are so cool</p>
<p align="center">*old people here are cool too (usually)</p>
<p align="center">*The beer is cheap</p>
<p align="center">*They serve steaks on sizzling metal skillets with bubbling eggs.  The steak place is full of high school girls who all want to giggle at me when I walk in the door.  I have been coming in so long now they all wave and come out of the back and scream &#8220;hello&#8221; laughing and I wave back they really seem happy to see me. </p>
<p align="center">*People are nice to strangers</p>
<p align="center">*Strangers are nice back</p>
<p align="center">*Yesterday, before Alice and I had Diner (when she showed me the error of my ways) we were riding bikes down the street.  Everything is blooming here and it is hot and the city street is filled with every conceivable thing to look at.  Out of nowhere I heard myself say to Alice &#8216;I am so glad to be alive.&#8217;  I didn&#8217;t really think about it before I said it but at that very moment I realized it was true.  God bless you China.</p>
<p align="left">So if I came off as an arrogant jerk to anyone else please let me know, and I am really from my heart sorry.  And don&#8217;t get me wrong, of all the things I wrote in that long rambling post I only take back one thing, I regret calling Alice &#8216;foxy&#8217;, I meant it nice but she didn&#8217;t apprieciate it, I take that back and I am embarrased and sorry.  Other than that it is all true as far as I can see, but I can also see how someone from China would get their dander up reading such from an outsider.  But I would hate to feel like I neglected to express what an amazing country I have found in China and how great a lot of the people really really are.  I respect that I am a guest in this country and while I feel it is my duty in my writting to say what I feel, I hate to think I came off as hating on China.  It is good here, you should come, you&#8217;d like it. </p>

					<p><em> T</em><em>his blog symmetrically begins and ends on a sleeper train</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>2/19/07</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>In the PM</em></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="padding-left: 1ex; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; border-left: #ccc 1px solid"><p><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q"></p>
<div />
<div><em /></div>
<div />
<div />
<p align="left">The beds on the train were bunks stacked three high and facing each other, making a little area of 9 beds total.  The bottom two seem to be understood as the spot where everyone sits and chit chats about this and that in manderin.  I had the misfortune to be assigned the bottom bunk on an earlier train heading some place and it was such a drag.  I remember wanting to strech out and relax in my bed but I couldn&#8217;t because four or five total strangers were sitting in my way having a fine time.  So on the night in question, the 19th, I took the very tip top bunk, which you get to by putting your feet on the other peoples beds and pulling your way up.  No ladder.  First thing I did on the train after stowing my gear was to climb up to that sweet sweet bed.   </p>
<div />
<div />
<div />
<div />
<p align="left">I wish to point out that Han Xiao Yin and I had been spending every single waking minute of every single day together.  This is way too much time to be around anyone, even someone as cool as my buddy Xiao Yin.  Tensions were starting to seep to the surface, the situation was getting snappy and fast.</p>
<div />
<div />
<div />
<div />
<p align="left">Xiao Yin had taken it upon himself to look out for me.  This was simaltaneously very very good and very very bad.  Good in that I had someone making sure I didn&#8217;t get ripped off or lost or killed mysteriously, bad because he demonstrated time and again that he had no power to turn it off.  Often he instructed me to eat more, not to buy something, always nagging me not to lose my passport, this sort of thing.  It was well natured and his heart was in the right place, sure.  In a big way I even apprieciated it at times, sure.  He was the only person in the world I could talk to, and I would have been miserable without his company, sure.  We had had some very cool moments so far on this trip in which two virtual strangers shared amazing unforgetable adventures, true.  At times the  comradery was such that we laughed from deep in our hearts like brothers, true.  Other times I was ready to kill him and he was ready to kill me, also true.</p>
<div />
<div />
<div />
<div />
<p align="left">So just after I had climbed my ass up to the top bunk and sighed &#8220;ahhhhh&#8221; Xiao Yin tells me that he thinks I should come back down to the bottom bunk with them.  Actually, he said &#8220;I could&#8221; go down to the bottom bunk as if granting me generous permission.  There was a couple down there who wanted to give me melon.  I really didn&#8217;t want any melon.  I really just wanted to be left alone to lay at the near ceiling summit of the train.  Xiao Yin laughed at my stupidity and assured me that I didn&#8217;t have to stay up there.  I let him know that I was fine.  The woman started reaching melon slices to the top for me, I shook my head and waved my hands, smiling.  She climbed higher and stuck it right in my face.  I was eating melon.  So I took a slice and started eating.  Xiao Yin told me &#8220;don&#8217;t eat the peels.&#8221;  I let him that I am 30 years old, and rolled over.  The lady tapped me on the shoulder, more melon.</p>
<div />
<div />
<div />
<div />
<p align="left">At least two or three more times Xiao Yin ordered me to come to the bottom bunk, he wanted to show me off to everybody I guess.  By now he was saying &#8220;I really think you should come to the bottom bunk.  He wasn&#8217;t smilling anymore.  Neither was I.  </p>
<div />
<div />
<div />
<div />
<p align="left">The next morning I gave him the silent treatment for a spell, then we talked about it and everything was fine for the most part from then on.  He got bossy sometimes, but I tend to get messugana sometimes too.  You try going on an endless road trip with someone for that long, in China of all places.  So for the record, Han Xiao Yin is a cool friend and all that happened was we got on each others nerves for a second there.  Everything was squashed easy.</p>
<p align="left">So Then we had to wait for two hours at a train station for our connection to take us to the next place.  We sat on the floor against a wall indian style with our stuff pilled next to us.  I wondered if there was any cool way to kill time in a train station.  There wasn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p align="left">I went to the bathroom area.  In China they have mens and woman bathrooms just like the states, but the mirror and sink is always communial and located outside the doors to both.  This train station was packed too, and it was around 7 or 8 am.  I squeezed my way through maybe fifty to a hundred poeple chaoticly trying to get close to a sink and mirror to do their morning thing.  It took ages, there were maybe ten mirrors total.  When I finally did make it to the front I stood right behind a couple who huddled close.  I watched them both brush their teeth, then he shaved and she put on make up.  They seemed aware of all the people waiting and they were clearly trying to go as fast as they could.  They handed each other the right toiletries at the right time without exchanging a word, it was almost telepathic.  They just knew each others morning routine so cold that they were both dead on each time.   It was like watching a silent movie version of a surgeory, the part where the doctor instructs the nurse &#8220;scaple, drill, flashlight.&#8221;  I brushed my teeth and then dry shaved for lack of soap.  I was so far beyond the point of caring.  A good hotel at this point was one with heat and hot water and a good meal was one that was on time.  A good morning was one where I had five minutes to brush my teeth and shave, soap or no.   </p>
<p align="left"><span class="q">I went and sat back down with Xiao Yin on the floor against the wall.  Francis my info man in the Yunnan came and asked for a drum lesson.  I showed him how to paradiddle (RLRRLRLL) on his knee and he picked it up in under a minute.  I showed him basic 4/4 rock beats with his foot hitting on one and three and his hand on two and four.  I counted yi, er, san, si (1, 2, 3, 4) and then switched the rhythms around on him.  He picked up everything so fast.  His brain was a beautiful thing, no wonder he was such a warehouse of historical information.  Have you ever meet someone who only needed to be told once?  smart smart smart, that guy.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p /></span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="q" /><span class="q">We then went to another shop, the entrance of which was flanked by guys wearing giant plastic heads that looked like anime cartoons of bald Chinese babies with gigantic eyes.  Yeah I asked for a picture, they said no, I don&#8217;t know why.  I would be proud of my gigantic plastic freaky baby head.  You would see me strutting with my big baby head.  </span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="q" />We went to an open air flower market where I was shoved aside by a man who (right in front of me) started punching the hell out of another guy.  For just a fraction of a split second my first instinct was to actually take one step closer, old Eagle Woods reflexes, I used to break up fighting gangsta thug kids for a living. Just for a fraction of a second though, like I said, not long.  The smart guy voice in my head kicked in quick and I took several more steps the hell away from there.  Oh, it was bad, too.  My best theory was that one of them was buying flowers for the other fellas wife or something, but just a guess.  So the cops showed up and drug them off, one guys face was bleeding, chaos and screaming.  </p>
<p align="left">In the parking lot Xiao Yin told me about the show Journey West, which is based on a famous ancient novel.  I have since seen the show, it is all about a monk, a pig king, and super monkey and they are all trying to get to India to retrieve sacred scrolls.  The problem is that all the evil monsters seem to think that eating the monks skin is a really good idea as it will make them live forever, so they are always getting chased around by cool monsters and animal people.  The show was made in the 70s and has crazy sets and martial arts and the story lines make little to no sense even when explained by a Chinese guy.  The one we saw that night in the hotel was about super monkey going to the sky and beating the crap out of everyone there until they gave him a job.  Finally (after he sufficiently beat the crap out of everyone in the sky mind you) the king of the sky said, ok, fine, we&#8217;ll give super monkey a job.  The cheeky king tricked super monkey by making him in charge of the horses in the sky and telling him it was a sweet gig.  Really, as the king and all his friends winkingly knew, it wasn&#8217;t such a sweet gig.  </p>
<p align="left">I think in order to picture the guy they had playing super monkey, imagine if Jackie Chan and Pee Wee Herman used their sperm to impregnate a baboon.  I hypothesize that if the offspring of this baboon stood upright and wore clothes and was somehow blessed with limitless magical powers and the ability to speak manderin for some reason you would have something very close to the super monkey I saw.</p>
<p align="left">So anyway, super monkey is so happy to have what he thinks is a fancy sky job, he smiles and claps and gleefully hops around all monkey like as they cut to stock footege of horses running, very remenicant of the work of Edward D Wood jr and his buffolo (PULL ZE STRINGS!!!)  Somebody finally spills the beans to super monkey that taking care of sky horses is sort of the sky equivilant of a sky shit job, and so super monkey goes bananas.  Thus the episode I saw of journey west symmetrically began and ended with super monkey furiously beating the crap out of everybody who worked in the sky.  </p>
<p align="left">Han Xiao Yin explained the whole story to me.  I asked him to repeat my favorite part over and over again for the next week, whenever I thought about it.  This was the part where it was explained about how the Pig king came to be a pig in the fisrt place.  Aparently he used to be a regular guy who worked up in the sky but the sky king got pissed off at him about something and kicked him out of the sky.  And so when he fell out of the sky he (for some reason) landed in a pigs uterus and came out a pig.  Yup, thats how it works.</p>
<p align="left"><span class="q">That was Februay and it is now April, I am still searching dilligently high and low for any dvd I can find, even though I don&#8217;t think I have much chance of finding it translated.  I don&#8217;t care, that is how amazing this damn show is.  </span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="q">So after the kerfuffle at the flower market we went to the Yunnan botanical expo, left over from some big event back in 1999.  It had a lot of cool flowers and plants, and it was huge, but I think over all sort of ho-hum.    </span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="q">The majority of the park was small mini gardens, each of which representing a province in China, sort of like a little put-put version.  Many of the gardens of places I had been (I guess) sort of reminded me of the place, but only if I really tried.  Hainan was dead on, they had a little lake surrounded by sand representing the beach and a hut with coconuts you could drink from.  We spent most of the day looking for the Henan (our province) garden.  Finally it started looking like they didn&#8217;t even have one.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="q">The Shangdong garden had a mini Tai shan, the mountain Xiao Yin and I climbed a few weeks ago.  In front of the mountain was a sign with a stick figure person climbing a ladder behind a DO NOT DO circle and cross.  The sign read</span></p>
<p align="center"><span class="q"><strong>NO SHINNEY</strong> </span></p>
<p align="left"><span class="q">Next, we went to the part of the expo which featured the mini earth, several small put-put gardens representing countries.  First we did Spain, which was a green house full of banzai trees.  There was a gift shop at one end and on a wall was a small painting of a matadore fighting a bull.  Traditional Spanish castanet music was blasting louder than a rave.  Next we went and paid a visit to jolly old England, which was enclosed by a brick wall on four sides and filled with lush tropical palm trees.  A sign in the corner explained that this was in fact the England garden so we were not in the wrong place.  England&#8217;s garden was next to the S</span>panish garden and therefor also blasted traditional Spanish castinet music.  Holland had a wind mill at least, which was good.  We tried to find America&#8217;s garden only to find out they used to have one, but it was torn down years ago.  Isreal had a garden, and so did Palestien, but they were located several gardens apart from each other, just to play it safe I think.  </p>
<p align="left">At the end of the day we found a little room near the gate behind the bathrooms in which were huddled small photo displays depicting all the misfit provinces unworthy of a put-put garden.  We found Henan, there was a big map.  We discussed different places we could go close enough to Shangqiu to do weekend trips.  It even had a picture of a rinky dink temple on the outskirts of Shangqiu.  It was kind of neat.</p>

<div>We got to sleep in all the way to 8, which was like heaven.  We then hiked all the way across Kunming to get to the bus that would take us to the lake.  The plan was we&#8217;d get bikes and just ride around, just the thing to do according to my guide book.</div>
<div>We had to stand up on the bus, it was so packed.  For the 40 minute ride I stood behind a man craddling a baby in his arms, somehow he managed to balance himself while holding his kid with both arms as the bus rocked and bumped.</div>
<div>Maybe it was the day before when I heard that my good friends Georganna and Andy had spewed forth progeny, Bellaluna Love Wiley.  Georganna and I have been great email pals over the past few years now, and she writes to me where ever in the planet earth she winds up.  She now lives with her husband in England, a man who she first met when he came riding into her life on a camel somewhere in Africa.  Their exploits traveling around the world served as an inspiration to me (I don&#8217;t mind saying) just as I hope that I may be able to convince and inspire someone somewhere reading this blog to do something cool in the same way.  Georganna has been completly out-to-lunch (I am talking the really cool kind of crazy here) as long as I have known her and that is going on 15 to 20 years, lord love her.  I am maybe the most disorganized person anywhere.  I am such a mess I can&#8217;t remember a pen number or pay a bill on time or any other of life&#8217;s little complications to save my life, yet here in China I sit.  Georgeanna and I managed to get it together enough to go and do really cool stuff, clear evidence that anyone can I would think.  It may be travel or it may be something else, my friend Ron (another inspiring cat) recently put everything on the line and rolled the dice and follewed his long time dream of starting a photo gallery.  That took some stone cold hutspa!  One day you will die and then you will be dead and then what will you do?  Now or never ya&#8217;ll, all I&#8217;m saying.  </div>

<div><span class="q">Yesterday I used skype to call my good friend Mike Dunham.  He jokingly asked if this was going in the blog.  I said I would think about it.  I forgot to ask him if he remembers the AT&#038;T ad with the guy answering the phone &#8220;alacapesay&#8221;.  I bet he does.  Just now, about five minutes ago I called Everybodies pizza to see who was drinking and talked with Luke for a sec.</span></div>
<div><span class="q" />Give me your phone number and I can try to call you too!<span class="q"><font color="#550055">  </font></span></div>
<div><span class="q"><font color="#550055">I don&#8217;t know why the words are purple now.  I could try to figure out how to fix it, but I think it is kind of nice, and I am too lazy.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="q"><font color="#550055"> So anyway, I got sidetracked. </font></span></div>
<div><span class="q" /><span class="q"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055">The bus stopped at this gawdy looking amuzment park and everyone got off.  We asked if we had to go through the park to get to the lake and somebody said we did.  We paid admission, a lady sold me her ticket on the cheap but still not cheap enough.  We checked to make sure that there was a place inside to rent bikes, they said yes, so we paid.  Easy come easy go. </font></font></font></font></span></div>
<div><span class="q"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><span class="q"><font color="#550055">I walked through the turnstyle and was bum rushed by a mob of people in traditional ethnic minority dress.  Here is the thing, they all had bamboo shot glasses and wooden bowls with liquid which they started pouring in my mouth.  At first I dodged and tried to stop them, then I cought a wiff of the stuff and it was alcohol, so I said what the hell.  It was the Chinese clear fire wine they love so much here and it was sudden and unexpected and burned like hell going down.  I didn&#8217;t want to seem rude, so I let them feed me four shots one after the other.  Just to be polite you understand.  Have to be a good embassador for my people don&#8217;t you know. </font></span>  </font></font></font></font></span></div>
<div><span class="q"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055">So I staggered out of the crowd to whooping cheers.  I smiled all crooked and told Xiao Yin that who ever these people are, they might be trying to kill me.  Xiao Yin said they want to give me so much because they love me.  Yes, they do.  They love me because I am clearly from out of town.  I guess they think that is cool.  The next second I had to jump out of the way of a ethnic minority conga line followed by a thundering line of dancing drummers.  Quite an entrance I made in this place.</font></font></font></font></font></span></div>
<div><span class="q"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055">This was a provincial theme park celebrting all the 56 tribes of ethnic minorities found in China, 52 of which hang their head dresses right here in the Yunnan province.  Cool, whatever.  Over the past week we had been through villiages and cities made up of the real thing.  What we had here was a touristy send up.  Learning about culture here would be the Chinese equivilant of studing the Cherokee people from a casino.  <span class="q"> </span></font></font></font></font></font></span></div>
<div><span class="q"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><font color="#550055"><span class="q">What the hell, where do they rent bikes around here?  We found the bike rental place in the park.  They only had bicycles built for two which rode side by side.   </p>

<div />     </p>
<div align="left">But we had set out for bikes, and these seemed to be the only ones around.  The stupid thing cost way too much money for a four hour rental.  It had a top speed of just shy of jog and was steered on the left side with a wheel like in a car.  It was the kind of thing Fred Flintstone might have except it had bike peddles instead of feet on the ground, and it was lame and stupid and bad instead of Hanna Barberra-esc and prehistoric and good.  On the upside, Xiao Yin assured me that in no way are two men riding side by side on a 2 person bike automatically considered gay.  Not in China anyway.  I just had to take him at his word.  <span class="q">What the hell, which way to the lake?  </p>
<div align="left">After tooling around the park for a time Xiao Yin asked a woman representing an ethnic minority called the Naxi tribe which way to get to the big lake.  She said that while the park boasts many small and piddley man made lakes, it does happen to lack any kind of access at all to the one rather large and famous lake we had been trying to get to all morning.  So after paying way too much to get in, we now found ourselves stuck with this non refundable four hour rental of the stupidest damn 2 person bike which we could not leave the park in.  At this point it was 10 am, our train left for Guilin at 3:45 which put us at the train station no later that 3:00 (if you have never been in a Chinese train station you will just have to trust me) and we were stuck, once again in a Chinese tourist trap.  I think what burned me up was that this time it was my fault, I had no Chinese tour company to blaim.  </div>
<div align="left">So we peddled around the tourist trap for the next few hours.  May as well, our money was spent.  When it was my turn to drive I liked to take us up hills and try to go down as fast as I could, Xiao Yin seemed to prefer to use his turn at the wheel tearing around off roading over grass lawns.  A few times we got stuck and had to get out and push.  These brief periods of pushing the lame bike through puddles and minor muddy spots provided us the most exciting times we had while piloting that rediculous insult to all bicycles everywhere.  </div>

</div>
<div>
<div align="left">It was at this park that Han Xiao Yin got a text message saying he had recieved and email from the University of Cleveland.  As I have previously indicated, Xiao Yin was trying to get into a post grad program in America, and it was just about time to start asking when the admissions office would have news.  Whenever he talked about it his whole body posture changed, I could tell he was on pins and needles.  Earlier in the trip he had asked me about each place he had aplied, New Jersey, Baltimore, Arizona, and Cleveland.  There may have been a few others too, but I can&#8217;t remember now.  I had tried my best to make Cleveland sound better than it was in case that was where he got stuck, but I made sure that he knew any of his other choices may be better.  I never been to Cleveland but my impression is that its cold and ugly, but with good working class beer.  Maybe I am being unfair, I never been like I said.</div>
<div align="left">So once again we found ourselves on yet another sleeper train.  This one left Kunming in the Yunnan Province at 4:00 in the afternoon and got into Guilin in the Guangxi the next day at 6 at night.  I was on the middle bunk.  I stayed there and got no argument from anyone.  Xiao Yin and I took turns reading the lonely planet guide book, we talked about the prospect of Cleveland, we watched the world go by out the window.  It was plesant.  The Yunnan landscape was all wide rolling plains sitting under rocky snowy mountains that climbed far into the sky.  Guanxi, on the other hand, was more chalk board mountains.  From flat rice fields and small farms they jutted suddenly in the air, imagine a five story spike coller covered in grass and trees.  They were almost too small to be mountains but way too big to be hills.  The further the train went the more we started seeing them until the horizon was a collection of distant blue sharp blades that could have been easily drawn by Dr Zeuss.   A pair of old folks eye balled me for the duration of the trip for no other reason I could figure beyond my obvious lack of Chinese-ness.  Back in January this would have given me a mad case of the creeps, but here it was Febuary so by now who cares?     </p>
<div align="left">
<div align="left">In the compartment next to us were three kids from America.  In the evening around super time I went over to say hello, I was driven by the aching itch to speak with someone at full speed again.  They were nice kids from Colorado.  I shared some of my beers with one of them.  They struck me as preshaving lilly white moon calfs, just out of college and off to see China with eyes full of dreamy stars and faces still aglow with stupid sunshine.</div>
<div align="left">The kid I shared my beer with had been in China for 8 months so far and was the seasoned vetron of the group, the other two were just arriving and on their way to take 6 month teaching jobs in Yangshou.  The Yangshou two didn&#8217;t want any beer, they had done quite enough the night before.  They explained that the night before they had had to carry one of their numbers home as he had dusted off the better part of three bottles of vodka in under three hours with very little help. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div align="left">Later in the evening I sat up looking out the window with the boy who had dusted off the better part of three bottles of vodka the night before with very little help.  I said something about how cool it was to be in China and to get to travel and stuff.  He sighed, showing that he was a weary 22 year old.  He shook his head slowly with a deliberate weight.  He explained that his dad had moved to France and his mom to England so this poor boy has to travel all over Europe a few times each year.  &#8220;Sometimes I just don&#8217;t feel like traveling and I just want to hang out and have a normal life.  It fucking sucks.&#8221;</div>
<p><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q" /><span class="q"></p>
<div align="left">I couldn&#8217;t think of anything to say so I just went back to looking out the window.</div>
<div align="left">The third guy they were traveling with didn&#8217;t talk much, I think he had a wierd &#8216;just-got-to&#8217; China stomach grotesque.  He had taught at an inner city school in New York for 6 months, the other two told me.  He said he used to break up fights all the time.  I told him about working at my old job at Eagle Woods gleeful, and we traded our best &#8216;teaching those lovable gangsta thug&#8217; stories for a while, which was nice.</div>
<p /></span></p>
<div align="left">We got to talking about things we had seen in the Yunnan province, the poor boy whose life &#8220;fucking sucked&#8221; because he had to travel Europe all the time pointed out that many Chinese men wore leather cowboy hats.  It seemed to really piss him off, too.  &#8220;Why would they wear something from <em>my</em> culture?  It would be like if I wore a fucking turbin.  <span class="q">I wouldn&#8217;t want to wear a fucking turbin!&#8221;  He raised his eyebrows and starred at me, his face stone cold frozen for emphisis.  I looked deep into his eyes and I could see that in fact he was telling the truth.  He really didn&#8217;t want to wear a fucking turbin.</span></div>
<div align="left">We sat up talking well after the 9:00 lights out pitch black was imposed on the entire train.  At one point the conversation turned to our spring festival trips so far.  They told me a story about a previous train they had been on a few weeks earlier. They told me that as they sat there a woman spread out newspapers in the area between the two sets of bunkbeds so her little child could crap on the floor.  Here is the really gross part so brace yourself, ready?  She didn&#8217;t even wipe the kid at all.  On top of which the kid pissed on the carpeted walkway along the side of the train without paper like it aint no thing.  Kids in China wear crotchless pants which just lets it all sort of hang out.  Even in the winter when they are wrapped several inches thick in jackets their little ying yangs and ding dangs are blowing in the wind.  And so they just crap and pee pee on the street freely until maybe age three or four, five or even six if they are really pushing it like my friend May&#8217;s kid.  It is just something I see all the time while walking down the street, I am used to it by now, no big deal.  Number-2 on the floor of a moving train however, is a bit surprising.  It gets worse, ready?  This was a very long trip, Northern China down into the Sichuan.  By the last stop they could see a rash developing in the kids crotch that was starting to look serious.  The 8 month China vet asked me if I wanted to know the best part, I said I did.</div>

					<p>It is time to take care of some bidness here at the adventure.  First I will plug a few things in Atlanta, then I need to give you the Chinese version of my address.  Please read and participate.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get the word that something is happening in Atlanta that makes me more homesick than usuall.  I was thinking I would take a few minutes and mention a few of these things.  I would go to these if I were not in China, if you live in the metro Atlanta area you should get out and see this stuff it is soo cool.</p>
<p>First is the Bloodcar screening at the Atlanta festival.  I am proud as hell to boast that I made some of the blood for this movie (the titchular blood) as well as a fake hippo with my friend Robert Paraguasu and even if that were not the case, and even if I wasn&#8217;t friends with the folks over at fake wood (some really really nice and cool people, no lie) I would think that Blood car may be the coolest movie ever.  It has been all over the place winning awards and I think it is really special and great and if you don&#8217;t go to see it on the big screen with the cast and crew you will regret it later and realize that you are stupid stupid stupid for not going to see blood car.  Go to see this movie as a favor to yourself.  you deserve it.  I am not shitting you, bloodcar really does rule.  It will make you laugh a whole lot and it is good and it even has blood and boobies.  Sort of a no lose kind of thing.<br />
here is the info as I copied and pasted it.</p>

<p>Here is another one that I wish I could do.  These are two great artists who make really good stuff that seems to always be way way cool.  They are really good friends and they have been making art for this show night and day.  They never ever ever suck so this show should be really really cool.  Caroline does a lot of clay and Julia is into metal but they have both infected each other in strange ways and so they are each utlizing both forms for the first time ever.  Julia has asked that I not use the word &#8216; infected&#8217; as people think that the two of them are wierd enough already.  I will use the word &#8216;infected&#8217; because I think it is funny and I am a real jerk sometimes.  It sure is true.  Here is the copied and pasted info:</p>

Also</p>
<p>here is the blah blah blah on my friend Erin&#8217;s posse of Atlanta artists.  It seems like a really good thing that will ultimatly stregthen the art scene in Atlanta, a the big perenial bitch of just about everyone I know.  Great things like bloodcar and Caroline and Julia&#8217;s show do happen all the time in Atlanta, but they go so much better and are so much more fun when people show up.  The good feelings coalition seems to be a just crazy enough to work sort of deal that everyone in A-town oughta know all about and support, just as they should be out supporting all the local art movies and music they can.  They got a Zene and they even got a coloring book.  When was the last time you got to do a coloring book?  they are still cool I think, just try not to eat so much playdow this time.<br />
here is the copied and pasted info she sent me:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">The Good Feelings Coalition is a non-profit organization dedicated to cultivating the exchange of information and ideas between contemporary artists and the community, increasing exposure for local artists, and creating unique opportunities for the artist to connect with the public. The Good Feelings Coalition provides resources and a forum for explorations of non-traditional public mediums such as collaboration, distribution, and interactivity. We also engage by circulating information about artists, venues, and art practice. The coalition celebrates creativity and experimentation and encourages an environment of innovative expression among artists and within the community as a whole.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">GOALS</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">- Curate, facilitate and financially support public art projects and exhibitions of local artists&#8217; work.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">- Publish and distribute the work of local artists through our magazine, LAZLO HOLLYFELD</p>
<p style="font-style: italic">- Provide convenient access to information about art related events and opportunities for artists.</p>
<p>And one last thing going down in Atlanta:<br />
Georgeanna and Andy and Their little un are going to Atlanta this summer around June I think and ask for everyone to make plans to see them.</p>
<p>finally I want to clearify what went down with the last blog: confusion went down.<br />
So Here are the Chinese Characters for my address, just print them and paste them directly to what ever you are sending if you are good enough to send anything.  My father sent me a packedge in January and I got it yesterday, so It may take a while, and please remember to get a tracking number, it may get lost in the mail and if so they will be able to find it, other wise you get what we got with my father and I.<br />
here is the english version:<br />
No. 96 Kaixuan road, Shangqiu city, Henan province<br />
China, 476000</p>
<p>Here is the Chinese which you can print out and stick on the box.</p>

					<p>Listen&#8230;.</p>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut died today, he was 84.   I just found out.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>
<p>The only book of his I thought to pack when I was coming to China was Timequake, not one of his best by a long shot.  I guess between which sweaters to bring and how much underwear to pack for a year I had my mind on other stuff.  When I saw the bullitin somebody posted on myspace about his passing I dug out timequake and started thumbing through.  Get this.  In the preface of timequake, right there on page xvi, Vonnegut builds in his own final absurd irony.  He explains that his alter ego, Kilgore Trout had died in 2001, he further explained that Mr Trout like Mr Vonnegut had lived to the ripe old age of 84! </p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>This is a bit I copied and pasted from the net which comes from his book man without a country.  He is telling the story of speaking at the memorial for Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a humanist means that you try to behave as decently, as honourably, as you can without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife. When we had a memorial service for Isaac a few years back, I spoke at it and said at one point, &#8216;Isaac is up in heaven now&#8217;. It was the funniest thing I could think of to say to an audience of humanists. Believe me, it worked - I rolled them in the aisles. If I should ever die, god forbid, I hope people will say, &#8216;Kurt is up in heaven now&#8217;. That&#8217;s my favourite joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurt is up in heaven now.</p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was my favorite writter and he was a hero of mine and I understand he was fabulously well to do.  I used to have a daydream where I met Kurt Vonnegut and got to tell him that my Grandfather helped strip down and rebuild the enola gay for its big trip across the pacific, although he didn&#8217;t understand what it was for at the time.  I would like to ask Vonnegut what he thought of my being the grandson of someone that close to such a horrible bombing, just like the children of blue ice nine. </p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>When I was in my early teens, one endlessly boring day in the summer I turned off the TV (which years later as a Bokonist I would recognize as a granfaloon) in exhaustion and picked up a dusty old copy of Breakfast of Champions and finished it that very day.  I thought <em>if this isn&#8217;t nice I don&#8217;t know what is</em>.  Here is something from breakfast of champions that grabbed my attention on a gut level of fancy maturity as an early teen that still sticks in my memory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">This is what an asshole looks like,</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>  That was the day it finally once and for all officially occured to me that I love the act of reading.  I think my whole world veiw as an adult has been warped due to his sad crazy books.  So goodbye to Mr. Vonnegut, Kilgore Trout, Duwayne Hubbler, Elliot Rosewater and the Rosewater foundation, Billy Pilgram, Bokonan and the others.  And goodbye blue monday. </p>
<p>Anyway, I am a big big Vonnegut fan and I am bummed.  To learn more about Kurt Vonnegut just pay a visit to your local library.
