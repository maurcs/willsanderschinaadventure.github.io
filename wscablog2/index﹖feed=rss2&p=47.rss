					<description>Will, reading your blog is like reading a Bill Bryson travelogue. Now I want to eat sheep eyeball and jump around with 70 Chinese 5 year olds barking like a dog. You're the best and I can't wait until you get back to the states and I can hear your stories in person!</description>

					<description>Man, that is so cool. You're my hero, Will-in-a-China-shop. 

You're like the Man with No Name in a monkey-version of Fistful of Dollars. Or Yojimbo. Whichever. 

Also, as for Doug Brown, of course he would know about monkeytown. Through his continued efforts to pass monkey voting rights, he would have researched the long-term effects of such legislation. Duh.</description>

					<description>WOW

I have been smiling all day thinking about monkey town, the sharks and the jets, stark blacks in whites, only the people are gray in Monkey Town. I am so glad that there is a place like this on planet earth. You move through the world so freely and honestly (bribes aside).

You must have fit in well with the Thai people, takes one to know one kind of nice guy kind of thing. "super nice and all huge smiles"</description>
