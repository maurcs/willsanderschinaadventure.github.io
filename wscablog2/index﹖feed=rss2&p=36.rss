					<description>That's pronounced She-ee-ei-oo-no-no-ne-no.

I have to say what's up to Xiao Yin who I have heard is reading this blog. And taking names.

Hey Xiao Yin thanks for sticking your neck out for our good buddy Will Sanders all this time, you are a true friend. Make sure to stop by Atlanta on you trip to America so we can return the favor.

Sanders do you need us to send you a ThighMaster!</description>

					<description>Fascinating as always, Will Sanders!

A professor that I had last semester is originally from Hong Kong.  He picked "Barry" as his English name.  When questioned, he explained that he named himself after Barry Gibb (of Bee Gees fame).  Teach your children well, Will.  Do not let this be their fate! =)

By the way, I am proud of you for hiking up that mountain too!</description>
